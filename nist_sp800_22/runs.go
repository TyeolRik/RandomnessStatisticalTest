/**
* From NIST SP800-22 Revision 1a.
* Test Purpose
* The focus of this test is the total number of runs in the sequence,
* where a run is an uninterrupted sequence of identical bits.
* A run of length k consists of exactly k identical bits and is bounded before and after with a bit of the opposite value.
* The purpose of the runs test is to determine
* whether the number of runs of ones and zeros of various lengths is as expected for a random sequence.
* In particular, this test determines whether the oscillation between such zeros and ones is too fast or too slow.
