/**
* From NIST SP800-22 Revision 1a.
* Test Purpose
* The focus of the test is the proportion of ones within M-bit blocks.
* The purpose of this test is to determine
* whether the frequency of ones in an M-bit block is approximately M/2,
* as would be expected under an assumption of randomness.
* For block size M=1, this test degenerates to test 1, the Frequency (Monobit) test.
